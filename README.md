## Description

This app simply allows a user to create and write notes, save them for future reference, and also have the option to delete them.

## Usage

Upon opening the web app, the user sees a basic landing page, where they can click the "Get Started" button, to be brought to the main application page.

To start, the user can give a title to their note entry so that it's easily identifiable for future access. Then, they just write whatever they wish to, and click the save button (floppy disk icon) in the top right of the screen.

Once a user has created and saved a note entry, they will be able to access it from the saved notes list on the left side of the app.

The user may then create a new entry by clicking on the pencil icon in the top right of the app.

If the user no longer needs or wants to store a particular note entry, they can very easily delete it. Simply locate the appropriate entry among the saved notes list, and click on the red trashcan icon to delete it.
